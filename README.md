# Supplementary Material 

Scripts and data necessary to produce theoretical Figures in **"Differences in vertical and horizontal transmission dynamics shape plasmid distribution in clinical enterobacteria"**, A Alonso-del Valle, L Toribio-Celestino, A Quirant, C Tardio Pi, J DelaFuente, R Canton, E Rocha, C Ubeda, R Peña-Miller and A San Millan.

The goal of this supplementary material is to posulate a mathematical model that can be used to perform computational simulations to better understand the dynamics of plasmid-bearing populations in multi-strain bacterial communities under antibiotic pressure.

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive, integrated view of the plasmid dynamics and its influence on antibiotic resistance within bacterial populations. This supplementary material is designed to facilitate understanding and further exploration of the theoretical model by providing a detailed walkthrough of our methodology, including the mathematical models, parameter estimations, and computational simulations we used in our study.

The repository is organized into a series of Jupyter notebooks, each detailing a different aspect of our research:

[Modelling of Bacterial Growth and Plasmid-Driven Antibiotic Resistance](py_pOXA48_SI1_model.ipynb): This notebook provides an overview of our mathematical model, which describes the growth kinetics and plasmid dynamics in clonal bacterial populations.

[Model parametrization](py_pOXA48_SI2_parametrization.ipynb): Here, we show how our model was parameterized using empirical data from lab-based experiments.

[Modeling plasmid dynamics in multistrain communities](py_pOXA48_SI3_multistrain.ipynb): In this notebook, we extend our model to multi-strain communities and describe the computational methods used to incorporate multiple strains into the model.

[Computational Simulations of Pair-wise Interactions](py_pOXA48_SI3_pairwise.ipynb): We present a series of computational simulations that depict the dynamics of pair-wise interactions between different bacterial strains in the presence of plasmid and antibiotic.

[Computational Simulations of Multi-Species Bacterial Communities](py_pOXA48_SI3_communities.ipynb): Finally, we use our model to simulate complex, multi-species bacterial communities and analyze the resulting dynamics under various selective conditions.
